<h2 id="media">Multimedia (video, audio) alternatives</h2>
<p>Information in podcasts or other audio is not available to people who are deaf or some people who are hard of hearing, unless it is provided in an alternative format such as captions and text  transcripts. Visual information in videos is not available to people who are blind or some people what have low vision, unless it is provided in an alternative format such as audio or  text. (Text can be read  by a screen reader or Braille display, or enlarged and reformatted for people with low vision.)</p>
<p> (Remember these easy checks  are not comprehensive or definitive.)</p>
<h3 class="whathead">What to check for:</h3>
<h4>Keyboard access</h4>
<p>Follow the steps above for <a href="#interaction">keyboard access</a> to ensure that the media player controls are labeled and keyboard accessible.</p>
<h4>Auto-start control</h4>
<p class="listintro">It is best if audio (including background noise and video with sound) does not start automatically when a web page opens. If it does start automatically, it should either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stop after 3 seconds.</li>
  <li>Include controls to pause or stop the audio.</li>
  <li>Include controls to turn down the volume.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Captions</h4>
<p>(Captions are known as &quot;subtitles&quot; in some areas.)</p>
<p>Most video on the web that provides captions has &quot;closed captions&quot; that can be turned on and off. (&quot;Open captions&quot; are always shown.) For example, in YouTube, you turn on captions with the CC button <img src="/WAI/content-images/preliminary/cc-button.png" alt="" width="26" height="21" /> (no known keyboard access). If there is not a CC button, there are no captions available for that video.</p>
<p>Automatic captions are not sufficient for accessibility because they are not accurate enough. For example, in YouTube, if only &quot;automatic captions&quot; are listed<!-- TODO Low Priority Add Image (as in the image above) -->, there are no sufficient captions and the video is not accessible. Captions in the specific language need to be listed.<!-- [@@ say more ?] --></p>

  <figcaption class="figcaption">Figure: Captions listed: French (automatic captions), Norwegian.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="listintro">If there are captions, you can check that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The captions seem in sync with the spoken content.</li>
  <li>The people who are speaking are identified when they speak.</li>
  <li>Important sound other than dialogue  &mdash; e.g., footsteps approaching, doors closing, glass breaking &mdash; is included.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Transcript</h4>
<p>It is best practice to provide both  captions and transcripts, although  not always required; <a href="http://www.uiaccess.com/transcripts/transcripts_on_the_web.html#benes">providing transcripts has many benefits</a> &mdash; both to people with disabilities and to website owners.</p>
<p class="listintro">Transcripts should be easy to find near the audio/video itself and any links to the audio/video.</p>
<p class="listintro">Check that  transcripts include all audio information, including dialogue with  the speakers  identified, and all important sound  &mdash; e.g., footsteps approaching, doors closing, glass breaking.</p>
<p>A transcript for a video could provide all the audio and all the visual information, so that a person can get all the content of the video by reading the text.</p>
<h4>Audio description</h4>
<p>Audio description (sometimes known as described video, video description, or visual interpretation) is description of important visual information in a video, in order to make it accessible to people who cannot see. For example, some videos start out with a title in text, have speaker names  in text, and have illustrations. That visual information  needs to be provided to people who cannot see the video. It can be provided through:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Audio description - where the audio track includes someone describing the important visuals. Audio description can be included in the main video, or it can be provided in a separate video.</li>
  <li>Text transcript - that includes description of meaningful visual information (so it's kind of like  a screenplay).</li>
</ul>
